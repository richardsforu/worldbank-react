step-1: identify ui application's state
    e.g: e-shop ui application
    -------------------------------
        - items
        - reviews
        - cart
        - user
        - orders
        - loadingStatus

step-2: identify fource/action(s) that causes state change
    eg: e-shop ui application
    --------------------------
        - LOAD_ITEMS
        - SEARCH_ITEMS
        - LOAD_REVIEWS
        - ADD_NEW_REVIEW
        - BUY
        - LOGIN
        - REQUEST_BEGIN
        - REQUEST_ERROR
        - REQUEST_SUCCESS

step-3: define reducer(s) , to process actions
    eg:
        - itemsReducer
        - reviewsReducer
        - cartReducer

step-4: combine all reducer(s) as rootReducer

step-5: create store with rootReducer and initialState
